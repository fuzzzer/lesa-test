# ðŸ“šâ€¯Lesa â€“ Architecture & Design Decisions

> **Context** â€“ This is my decisions and rough guide to _Lesa Flutter Dev Test_ app. It explains **why** the codebase looks the way it does, the architectural choices I made, and how it works as a whole. First of all, probably most important decision I made was to use my template when creating the project (only partly for what I needed, or felt would be beneficial for the project), since I noticed I needed to recreate some of the elements to write good and well structured code.

## 1â€ƒHighâ€‘level overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph Entrypoints
    A1[main_development.dart] --> APP
    A2[main_staging.dart]     --> APP
    A3[main_production.dart]  --> APP
    A4[main.dart]             --> APP
  end

  APP[App] --> ROUTER[LesaRouter]
  APP --> CORE[Core]
  ROUTER --> FEATURE[NarratedReading]

  subgraph " "
    CORE --> SERVICES[Services]
    CORE --> L10N[Localisation]
    CORE --> EXT[Extensions]
  end

  FEATURE --> UI[UI]
  FEATURE --> LOGIC[Bloc]
  FEATURE --> REPO[Repository]
  REPO --> MODELS[Models]
```

- **Featureâ€‘based MVVM/MV*O*** â€“ In the project I used one of the architectures provided by the official [Flutter app architecture docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture) but with little tweaks. Each _feature_ owns its UI widgets, blocs, repositories and models.
- **Template baseline** â€“ I bootstrap new projects with a personal template that already provides environment handling, theming, localisation, DI and helpful helpers (check `core/`, `app/` directories of the app), so it cuts about month of setups, this way we can just straight into writing the business logic related code.

## 2â€ƒFolder structure (abridged)

| Path                    | Responsibility                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/app/`              | **Global App Related Configurations**: global blocs, router, env bootstrap, theme. |
| `src/core/`             | **Reusable utilities** â€“ serviceâ€‘locator, logger, candy tools, localisation, etc.  |
| `src/narrated_reading/` | **Business feature** delivered for the test. â”‚                                     |
| Â Â `bloc/`               | Cubits (`BookCubit`, `AudioControllerCubit`).                                      |
| Â Â `models/`             | Immutable models (`BookData`, `BookPageData`).                                     |
| Â Â `repositories/`       | Data layer â€“ currently local JSON, swappable for remote.                           |
| Â Â `ui/`                 | Pages & reusable widgets, folder for building ui of the feature                    |

> **Scalability** â€“Â New games/chapters will be added next to `narrated_reading/` as their own feature folders.

## 3â€ƒData flow inside a feature

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as Widget
  participant Bloc as Bloc/Cubit
  participant Repo as Repository
  participant Model as DataÂ Model
  UI->>Bloc: user intent (e.g. nextPage())
  Bloc->>Repo: fetch/update data
  Repo-->>Bloc: model(s) / failure
  Bloc-->>UI: new state (immutable)
```

- **Unidirectional flow** keeps sideâ€‘effects inside `Bloc`/`Repository`. Widgets are stateless and easy to test.
- **Serviceâ€‘locator (GetIt)** is injected where needed, but feature code can also be constructorâ€‘injected (easier for testing),
  but not needed at the early stages of the project ().

## 4â€ƒKey decisions

| Area               | Decision                                                      | Rationale                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project layout     | **Featureâ€‘based** (vs layerâ€‘based)                            | A Duolingo like app will have of games, chapters, etc. For organizational purposes chosen to prioritize features |
| Ui Kit             | **Separate package**                                          | Usually better to separately, so we have better separation of concerns. Also can be developed independently      |
| State management   | **Bloc/Cubit**                                                | Familiar to most Flutter teams, excellent dev tools, predictable streams, easy to generate                       |
| Audio              | **Perâ€‘page audio files**                                      | Added simple audio files for each page, just tried to guess the logic, hope it works for test assignment         |
| Localisation       | **ARBâ€¯+ generated localizations** in `core/l10n/`             | Production ready. can be extended to Icelandic easily.                                                           |
| Environment config | `.env` files via my template (`Environment.development` etc.) | Allows staging & production builds from the start.                                                               |
| Codeâ€‘gen helpers   | Simple **Python scripts** (export fixer, audio TTS generator) | Speeds up repetitive chores, kept outside Flutter tree.                                                          |

## 6â€ƒRunning the demo

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart
```

Ensure your device/emulator has audio enabled so you can hear the narrated pages when played.
